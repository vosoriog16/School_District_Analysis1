# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.

###The purpose of this analysis is to find the overall passing percentages of the students and decide if there is any correlation with the budget that is alloted with each student. It was discovered that there was a discrepancy for test scores from the 9th grade of Thomas High School, where there were missing test scores, specifically for reading and math.
We want to see how completing this analysis will describe how these changes affected the overall analysis. 


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions.

###How is the district summary affected?

The district summary is affected because before the data was formatted the average math and reading scores, the percentage passing for math and reading and overall passing were 79.0, 81.9, 75, 86, 65. After the data formatting the scores were 78.9, 81.9, 74, 85, 64. This shows that there was a slight decrease in percentage averages for the district.

###How is the school summary affected?

Before the data formatting Thomas High School overall passing was 91, getting second place; after the formatting the overall passing was 65, getting eight place. The overall ranking order changed positions, with other schools moving upwards.

###How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?

Replacing the ninth graders math and reading scores overall would not affect either scores. The ranking changed to a lower level as the overall passing percentage decreased from 91% to 65%. 

###How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:

####Math and reading scores by grade

For Thomas High School 9th grade math & reading scores are set to "NaN". The passing percentage score is reduced as the total number of students remains the same but total passing value decreases by the number of removed 9th grade scores.

####Scores by school spending

The numbers remain nearly the same since 9th graders are removed from the analysis

####Scores by school size

The numbers for overall passing percentage do not change 

####Scores by school type

The numbers for school type do not change.

## Summary:

###With the completion of the analysis and replacing of the scores of the 9th grade student, we notice there have been some slight changes. We voided certain values that may have altered the school size, school spending, school type and overall passing percentageof the students.
